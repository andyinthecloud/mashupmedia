Add as many music libraries as you like and Mashup Media will provide a clean, elegant interface to quickly access and play your tunes.

A lot of time has been dedicated into making the Mashup Media music experience very special. Music is categorised into artist, albums, genre and year by the music tags or failing that the folder structure. Album art is extracted either from the music tag or the folder. Libraries can contain very large amount of files with minimal impact to performance. Any changes to the library files are automatically detected making sure that the libraries are always sychronised.

### Compatibility
You can listen to your music on all modern html5 compatible web browsers on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
### Playlists
You can create and share music playlists.
